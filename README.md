Calculator Project:

This repository contains my final project from The Odin Project's Foundations course: a functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Thanks to the supportive TOP / Odin Project community for keeping the curriculum open-source, accessible, competitive, comprehensive, and free.
